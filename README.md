# Vehicle-service-management-system

This application is developed using Angular 2, HTML and CSS. Routing is used for page redirections. It has following features:

1. There	should	be	a	home	screen,	which	display	a	list	of	the	pending/complete	vehicle	service	requests. By	default	the	list	should	be	empty.	

2. Clicking	on	the	Add	New	Request	button	redirects	the	browser	to	a	Request	Form	screen	as	depicts	in	the	below	wireframe.	Once	user	submits	the	request	from	the	Request	Form	screen,	the	browser	should	be	redirected	to	the	home	screen	and	submitted	request	should	be	get added	to	the	home	screen	list.	

3. Clicking	on	the	View	button	(from	the	home	screen)	redirects	the	browser	to	the	Request	View	screen.	All	the	controls	in	the	Request	View	screen	are	same	as	in	Add	New	Request	but	are	non-editable.	User	can	navigate	to	the	home	screen	by	clicking	on	the	Back	to	home	screen	button.	

4. Clicking	on	the	Delete	button remove	the	request	from	the	system.	

5.Clicking	on	the	Undo	button	(from	the	home	screen)	undo	the	last	action	item	â€“	addition	of	a	new	request	or	deletion	of	the	exiting	request.	

6. Application	state	should	be	persistence	in	nature.	If	user	opens	the	application	again,	browser	should	display	the	last	state	(before	closing)	of	the	application	including	respective	screen	and	number	of	records.	

7. Duplicate	records	are	not	allowed.
